# ELDR-pytorch
A PyTorch implementation of the paper "Explaining Groups of Points in Low-Dimensional Representations"

Paper Authors: Gregory Plumb, Jonathan Terhorst, Sriram Sankararaman, Ameet Talwalkar

Code by authors: https://github.com/GDPlumb/ELDR

This is *not* the "official" implementation of the paper.

I am in no way affiliated with the authors.

This is just my take and some experimental stuff based on the paper.

An example on how to use this pytorch module can be found in `iris.ipynb`
